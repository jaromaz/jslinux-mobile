# JSLinux Mobile – Linux for iOS

<a href="https://jm.iq.pl/jslinux-mobile"><img align="right" width="280" height="497" src="https://jm.iq.pl/jslinux-mobile/js_linux_mobile_for_iOS.gif"></a>A
mobile version of a PC emulator written in Javascript, with a running, fully functional
Linux system. The emulator can be run offline in full-screen mode on iOS and Android devices.

Apple does not allow hardware emulation in iOS – the AppStore has no such software, so I have
transformed the perfect Linux emulator by Fabrice Bellard (with his kind permission) so that
it works properly with iOS device keyboards and bluetooth keyboards.
All is available in full-screen mode simultaneously emulating modern terminals – with appropriate
fonts and window appearance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

For full-screen mode open JSLinux Mobile in the Safari browser and look in its menu for an
option named *Add to Home Screen* - a new icon will be created in your applications. The
default preset is intended for iPad with a bluetooth keyboard, but you can change the
appearance of the application to fit your iPhone or any other device. Each change of the
settings will be saved in cookies and stored.

JSLinux Mobile can also be used on regular computers e.g. in schools or universities
to practice programming in **C**, **bash**, **awk** and **sed**, or to create a pseudo-network
(because this version of the emulator does not allow Linux to connect to the Internet),
and learn the basic Linux commands thanks to the **Busybox** software. 

In the video bellow, I present the capabilities of the emulator in combination with
an iPad Mini and a bluetooth keyboard:
